As part of an initiative by the Autonomous University of Zacatecas to enhance remote health monitoring capabilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a comprehensive data collection effort was conducted involving wearable devices. These devices were used to gather wrist and forehead temperature data from 30 volunteers, totaling 2,130 samples. The collection focused on assessing the accuracy of wearable devices in estimating core body temperature.

## Data acquisition
In the data acquisition process, thirty subjects participated in an experiment to measure temperature using sensors placed on their forehead and wrist. All participants were student volunteers between 19 and 24 years old, and their health data was not considered during measurements. Furthermore, the experiment was conducted in the same room at the Autonomous University of Zacatecas under artificial light conditions.

Before starting the measurement process, participants were instructed to wait ten minutes to acclimate to the ambient temperature. Following this, the WD sensors was attached to the participants for 15 minutes, with a sampling rate of 12-13 seconds due IoT latency, resulting in a total of 2130 samples.

Both the WD and the commercial COVID-19 sensor are utilized in the measurements, facilitating a subsequent comprehensive comparison. The protocol for making the measurements is as follows: Initially, the WD and COVID-19 sensors were employed to measure FT, placed at a distance of 1 cm, and then the distance gradually increased to 2.5 and 5 cm for five-minute intervals. Simultaneously, measurements of the temperature on the wrist were recorded by the WD at a fixed distance. 

The data from 2130 samples has been stored on a cloud platform to establish a correlation between the temperature measured on the wrist and the forehead.
